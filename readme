(
    This is commonly in the bottom of js code
    uncomment line no:- 700
    or 
    uncomment 
    this line in, async function renderApp() 
    document.getElementById("app").innerHTML = html;
)
and 
(   comment 
    This is commonly in the top of js code
    let user = null;
    and this function
    window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async () => { })

)
    
2) if you want to do login first before using shopPage, then
(
    This is commonly in the bottom of js code
    comment line no:- 700
    or 
    comment 
    this line in, async function renderApp() 
    document.getElementById("app").innerHTML = html;
)
and 
(
    This is commonly in the top of js code
    uncomment 
    let user = null;
    and this function
    window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", async () => { })
)

3) subscribe to update productQty automaticaly when key expire
this is nessecary if you use docker to run rdis then run this command in redis(http://localhost:8001/redis-stack/browser) 
config set notify-keyspace-events Ex
every time we have to run this we start the redis 

4)
    const reservedQty = parseInt(await client.get(resKey), 10) || 0;
    if resKey is  like this  "abce" then reservedQty =0
    if resKey is like this "10100" then reservedQty = 10100, with base 10.

5) final order may be different, because time limit exceede of another proudct.or if user didn't buy product under limited time
like if he select one product then it's count started, and if he selecte 2nd product then count started it.

Performance: Both commands are O(1) for single operations, but HSET can be slightly slower for large hashes due to field lookups. However, it’s negligible for most use cases.
Memory: HSET is more memory-efficient for structured data, as it avoids key overhead. For example, storing 100 fields with SET requires 100 keys, while HSET uses one key.
Scalability: HSET is better for scaling applications with complex data, as seen in your MongoDB and Redis usage in projects.
Redis Version: HSET supports multiple field-value pairs in one command since Redis 4.0.0. For older versions, use HMSET (now deprecated).

HSET:
What it does: Stores multiple field-value pairs within a single key, treating the key as a hash (like a lightweight dictionary or JSON object). You can update individual fields without affecting others.
Use case example: Storing structured data like user profiles, product details, or configuration settings under one key.
HSET user:1 name "Ashish" age 23 email "ashish777766669@gmail.com"
HGET user:1 name  # Returns "Ashish"
HGETALL user:1    # Returns all fields: ["name", "Ashish", "age", "23", "email", "ashish777766669@gmail.com"]
HINCRBY user:1 age 1  # Increment age to 24
